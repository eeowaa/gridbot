CRITICAL {{{

=====
Bug 1
=====
The 'wallHugUntil' function is extremely dangerous when the enemy robot is around
- Results in "washing machine" behavior (i.e. the robot gets stuck tracing
  a 4-node circular path)

=====
Bug 3
=====
Robot recalculates path home as it travels along the edge of the grid (any of the
four edges)

}}}
HIGH {{{

=====
Bug 5
=====
Robot doesn't always choose the path with the fewest number of turns (ex: when robot goes up
right side and along top, it avoids the top-right-most space even though it could use it,
thus adding an extra turn)

=====
Bug 6
=====
Cannot open, save, and save as test files. This can be fixed by reading in '\b' characters
from console and deciding what to do with it (likewise for other operators like '\n').

}}}
MEDIUM {{{

=====
Bug 7
=====
Does not react smartly to blocks two spaces in front (will willing go toward these
blocks). Can fix by adding a heuristic to avoid blocks at certain times in fear that
they are the enemy robot.

}}}
LOW {{{

=====
Bug 8
=====
Virtual Grid does not work on Windows
